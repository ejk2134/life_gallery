                                    This is one of the highlights of a photo shoot I had
                                    with some of my best friends in the world. We're an odd bunch. We never
                                    manage to take a photo where at least one of us isn't making a goofy face,
                                    so naturally I chose one where my face is mostly normal.

                                    are beautiful. We've spent so much time together that we share all sorts
                                    of bizarre rituals. Find us on Thanksgiving making your family recipes look lame.

                                    This is a photo of a protester in Ferguson during the aftermath of the police
                                    killing of Michael Brown. I believe this form of nonviolent protest is vital for change,
                                    and I use this picture as a reminder of the work that needs to be done in the world
                                    and the capacity for lots of people to combine their voices when they're fired up. I also
                                    <i>really</i> like that this guy is holding a bag of chips.

                                    This is a picture from the 2013 movie <i>The Wolf of Wall Street</i>. This is one of
                                    my favorite movies. It is a rollercoaster of emotion: absolutely hilarious through and
                                    through, while stirring anger about one of the most pernicious forms of greed in the world.
                                    The main character, Jordan Belfort, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, has an impressive sort of 
                                    charm that makes part of you want to root for him through much of the movie, even as 
                                    you cheer on the FBI agent stalking him.
